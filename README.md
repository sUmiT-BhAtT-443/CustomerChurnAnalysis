# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

An end-to-end **Customer Churn Analytics and Prediction project** built using  
**SQL Server, Python (Machine Learning), and Power BI** to identify churn drivers, predict high-risk customers, and support data-driven retention strategies.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for subscription-based businesses.  
This project focuses on:

- Understanding customer churn behavior
- Identifying key factors driving churn
- Predicting customers likely to churn
- Visualizing insights using interactive dashboards

The project follows a **complete analytics lifecycle** from raw data to business-ready insights.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **SQL Server** – Data cleaning, transformation, views
- **Python** – Data preprocessing, ML model training
- **Machine Learning** – Random Forest Classifier
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards & reporting
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Model development & evaluation

---

## 🗂️ Data Architecture

### Tables
- **stg_Churn** → Raw staging data
- **prod_Churn** → Cleaned production data

### Views
- **vw_ChurnData** → Customers who *Stayed* or *Churned*
- **vw_JoinData** → Newly *Joined* customers (used for prediction)

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation (SQL)

- Replaced NULL values with business-friendly defaults
- Standardized categorical columns
- Created production-ready tables
- Built views for analytics and ML pipelines

Example:
```sql
ISNULL(Internet_Type, 'None') AS Internet_Type,
ISNULL(Churn_Reason, 'Others') AS Churn_Reason
